### *Background*
This was a project undertaken to support researchers studying the dual role of dopamine to drive reinforcement learning and behavior motivation in the fruit fly *Drosophila*. The previously-existing system involves a fruit fly tethered to a pin and walking on an air-suspended omni-directional treadmill as shown in the picture here.

A great open-source tool called FicTrac exists to capture the motion of the ball, and convert it to a fictitious 2-dimensional planar trajectory for the fly. If the fly is left on the ball with no stimulus, its 2-dimensional path is essentially a forward-biased random walk.

Flies have an innate interest in walking upwind, so a tube providing air is positioned in front of the fly to induce it to walk forward. We use a stepper motor to adjust the angle of the tube, such that if the fly turns 90 degrees, the air now strikes its side. Remember! The fly is not actually walking anywhere, but has been fooled to thinking it is walking on an infinte 2-D plane with a wind source.
