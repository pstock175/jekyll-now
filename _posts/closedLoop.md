### *Background*
This was a project undertaken to support researchers studying the dual role of dopamine to drive reinforcement learning and behavior motivation in the fruit fly *Drosophila*. The previously-existing system involves a fruit fly tethered to a pin and walking on an air-suspended omni-directional treadmill as shown in the picture here.
