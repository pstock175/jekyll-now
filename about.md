Hi, I am an engineer with a wide span of interests. My educational background is in mechanical & robotics engineering, but I also make things using machine learning and data science. I am from New Hampshire and am currently bouncing between New Hampshire, Boston and NYC.

My interests in technology include robotic sensing & navigation, deep learning for medicine and agriculture, and computing for art & design.

My interests outside of technology include reading, skiing, vegetarian food, New York City history, The Simpsons, mechanical watches, drawing with my girlfriend, Mario Kart, Sid Meier's Civilization, and running 5k races with my brothers and dad.
